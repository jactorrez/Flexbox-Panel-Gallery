### Taking advantage of the power of Flexbox

A small, and fun, project from the [#Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge. To start off the new year, I wanted to dive deeper into Javascript by learning and using the new and more advanced (and sometimes obscure!) syntax introduced in ES6 in small projects. In the process I also wanted to get more familiar with vanilla Javascript. There's no better way to start than with the \#Javascript30 challenge to build 30 vanilla JS projects in 30 days.

Like the project that involved working with JS' array methods, working with Flexbox was not something new to me. However, this project really harnessed the power of Flexbox in a unique way that in the end blew me away and made me re-think how I thought about Flexbox. In fact, it had a huge impact on how I thought Flexbox should be used and on how I'll think about Flexbox in future projects.
